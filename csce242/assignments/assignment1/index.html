<h1> Connor's Soccer Career </h1>
    <p> Connor played soccer all four years in highschool. It was his favorite sport
        to play. Even though his team was not very good, he had fun because he  was
        playing with all of his friends. Connor holds the record of most yellow cards
        in a single season. 
     </p>

    <p> Connor played a lot of different positions during his time on the field. Some
        games he would play defense. Other games he would be up on offense scoring goals.
        During his freshman year, he scored 9 goals. Tied his friend Pearse for 1st place
        in most goals in a single season.
