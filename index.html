    <p>
      This diagram does a great job of listing the major ideas associated with college students getting better access to healthy and nutritious food. 
      The five main sections all the ideas fall under include "long term", "shipping/transportation", "advertising/marketing", "costs', and "dietary options".
      These five groupings are important because they help us map out all the ideas that are associated with our problem.
      It is easier to see the ideas all mapped out at once, rather than a couple at a time.
